        <h1>What is Context Api?</h1>
        <p>
          <span>Ans: </span> Context provides a way to share values like these
          between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through
          every level of the tree. It gives our components the ability to
          communicate and share data at different levels. Context is designed to
          share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React
          components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or
          preferred language. Using context, we can avoid passing props through
          intermediate elements. Context is primarily used when some data needs
          to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.

        <h1>What is Semantic tag?</h1>
        <p>
          <span>Ans: </span> The semantics tags provide meaning to an HTML page
          rather than just presentation. It makes HTML more comprehensible by
          better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. The
          pages made with semantic elements are much easier to read. It has
          greater accessibility. It offers a better user experience. The
          semantic HTML tags help the search engines and other user devices to
          determine the importance and context of web pages.
